# Death Tracker

Discord bot to track when players are killed on Tibia.    
It is currently configured for [Seanera](https://github.com/Leo32onGIT/death-tracker/blob/main/death-tracker/src/main/scala/com/kiktibia/leveltracker/tibiadata/TibiaDataClient.scala#L20).

  `no color` = neutral pve    
  `white` = neutral pvp    
  `red` = ally    
  `green` = hunted    
  `purple` = rare boss (this pokes)

It will also poke a [discord role](https://github.com/Leo32onGIT/death-tracker/blob/main/death-tracker/src/main/resources/application.conf#L23) if someone dies to a [tracked monster](https://github.com/Leo32onGIT/death-tracker/blob/main/death-tracker/src/main/resources/application.conf#L24-L94).
